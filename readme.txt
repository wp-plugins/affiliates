The Affiliates plugin provides the right tools to maintain a partner referral program.

== Description ==

The Affiliates plugin provides the right tools to maintain a partner referral program.

If you need to **track visits to your site** with **affiliate links**, the affiliates plugin is probably right for you. It provides the tools to maintain a **partner referral program**.

Simply put, the affiliates plugin is used to manage and track visits to your site through affiliate links.
Referrals can also be stored and attributed to an affiliate, for example if clients place orders on your site and you need to credit your affiliates.

If you require **support** or **customization** including **referrals integration** with your site, you may [contact me here](http://www.itthinx.com/) and consider making a [donation](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/affiliates).

After installing the plugin you can start adding affiliates and provide them with affiliate links to your site.
The default options should be suitable for many, but there are some options you might want to consider before you really start.

Full documentation is accessible from the [Affiliates plugin page](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/affiliates). 

Although the options are documented on each page and are generally intuitive or self-explaining, a quick introduction is useful ...

The 'Affiliates' menu provides these sections:

#### Affiliates ####

Here an overview is provided with summarized statistical data, including your currently operative affiliates, total hits, visits and referrals.

#### Manage Affiliates ####

This is where you add, remove and manage your affiliates. For each affiliate, the appropriate affiliate links are shown so that these can be conveniently employed on your affiliates' sites.

#### Visits & Referrals ####

Provides per-day information:

This page shows a summary of unique Visits, Hits and Referrals as well as a Ratio that shows the conversion rate (Referrals/Visits) on a daily basis.
Extended information can be shown, including information about pages or posts that produced referrals as well as their date and time and IP addresses that produced hits.
Data can be conveniently sorted and also filtered by affiliate and time period.

#### Affiliates & Referrals ####

Provides per-affiliate information:

For each affiliate, the number of unique Visitors, Hits, Referrals and Ratio (Referrals/Visitor) are shown.
Detailed information about each referral can be expanded as well as for hits.
Data can be conveniently sorted and also filtered by affiliate and time period.

#### Referrals ####

Provides per-referral information:

For each referral, the date and time, corresponding post and affiliate is shown.
Additional data and referral descriptions that have been recorded using the plugin's API are shown for each referral.
Data can be conveniently sorted and also filtered by affiliate and time period.

#### Options ####

##### Referral timeout #####

The referral timeout determines for how long a visit via an affiliate link will produce a referral.
This setting can be adjusted to range from the individual session to a number of days.

##### Direct referrals #####

The affiliates plugin can be used to store transaction data even if no affiliate was involved.
This settings determines if 'direct' referrals are stored. This are accessible through a 'Direct' affiliate who represents the site's owner or organization.

##### Robots #####

Hits from affiliate links that have originated from robots listed here will not be taken into account.

By default there are no entries but you can start with this example:

##### Affiliate ID encoding #####

Either plain or MD5-encoded affiliate IDs can be used. These are appended to your affiliate's link.

##### Permissions #####

For each role these permissions can be set:

* Access affiliates: to be able to see information accessible through the *Affiliates* menu in WordPress.
* Administer affiliates: to add, remove and manage affiliates.
* Administer options: grants access to make changes on this *Options* page.

##### Deactivation and data persistence #####

A convenient option is provided to delete all data that has been stored by the affiliates plugin.
This option is useful if you just need to start clean while you run tests.

#### What this plugin is not ####

It is not intended to keep track of links to other sites that you as a member of an affiliate program may have.
